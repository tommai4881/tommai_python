This annual event commemorates the death of Jesus Christ, which is central to their faith and salvation. \n","\n","The Memorial typically lasts for an hour during the evening meeting at the Kingdom Hall, featuring a lengthy Biblical talk about Jesus' sacrifice and ransom. Attendants pass around Memorial emblems, consisting of unleavened bread and unadulterated wine, with only the 144,000 anointed individuals partaking.\n","\n","The Memorial is observed annually on the date corresponding to the Jewish Passover, specifically on the evening of **Nisan 14** in the Hebrew calendar. Unlike most Christians, Jehovah's Witnesses do not celebrate Christmas, Easter, birthdays, or national holidays.\n","\n","## Why an Algorithm Is Necessary\n","To determine the approximate date of the Memorial, I have developed an algorithm that calculates the corresponding Gregorian calendar date each year. The actual Memorial date may vary by ±2 days. This algorithm accounts for various factors, including lunar cycles and historical data, ensuring the Memorial is accurately aligned with the scriptural events it honors.\n","\n","In this notebook, we will explore the steps involved in calculating the date of the Memorial, along with a Python implementation of the algorithm. By understanding the underlying principles, we can gain insight into the significance of this important observance in the faith of Jehovah's Witnesses.\n","\n","## Source\n","Most of the code is derived from formulas found at [Oremus Almanac - Computus](http://almanac.oremus.org/easter/computus/), which discusses finding the Easter date that Jehovah’s Witnesses abstain from due to Easter's pagan origins."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"884643a5","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.002015,"end_time":"2024-12-06T06:06:46.146572","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-12-06T06:06:46.144557","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# The Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"118a2942","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ecd659c8-48da-41e9-899d-a60f457cb6c8","_uuid":"b5747dae-f5a5-42f2-b2b8-2ba1756b3570","collapsed":false,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-06T06:06:46.152302Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-06T06:06:46.151931Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-06T06:06:46.164611Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-06T06:06:46.163375Z"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"papermill":{"duration":0.017907,"end_time":"2024-12-06T06:06:46.166533","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-12-06T06:06:46.148626","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["(24, 3)\n"]}],"source":["def memorial(y): \n","    \"\"\"\n","    Finding date for Jehovah's Witnesses' Memorial of Jesus' Death, the only holiday for Jehovah's Witnesses, who celebrate neither Christmas, Easter, birthdays nor national holidays.

The Memorial is the only holiday celebrated by Jehovah's Witnesses, who do not observe traditional holidays such as Christmas, Easter, birthdays, or national holidays.\n","\n","## Code Breakdown\n","\n","1. **Golden Number Calculation:**\n","   ```python\n","   g = y % 19 + 1  # golden number\n","   ```\n","   The variable \\( g \\) represents the **Golden Number**, which is determined by the year modulo 19, plus 1. This number is used in the calculations of the Paschal Full Moon.\n","\n","2. **Calendar Check:**\n","   ```python\n","   if y > 1582:  # gregorian calendar\n","   ```\n","   The function first checks if the year \\( y \\) is greater than 1582 to determine whether to use the **Gregorian calendar** or the **Julian calendar**.\n","\n","3. **Gregorian Calendar Calculations:**\n","   ```python\n","   s = (y - 1600) // 100 - (y - 1600) // 400  # solar correction\n","   l = (8 * (y // 100 - 14)) // 25  # lunar correction\n","   p = (3 - 11 * g + s - l) % 30  # paschal full moon\n","   ```\n","   - The variable \\( s \\) represents the **solar correction** based on the century.\n","   - The variable \\( l \\) represents the **lunar correction**, which accounts for the difference between the lunar and solar years.\n","   - The variable \\( p \\) calculates the **Paschal Full Moon**, which is essential for determining Easter and related observances.\n","\n","4. **Edge Case Handling:**\n","   ```python\n","   if p == 29 or (p == 28 and g > 11):  # edge case\n","       p -= 1\n","   ```\n","   This checks for edge cases where the Paschal Full Moon may affect the date calculation, adjusting \\( p \\) accordingly.\n","\n","5. **Julian Calendar Calculations:**\n","   ```python\n","   else:  # julian calendar\n","       p = (26 - 11 * g) % 30\n","   ```\n","   If the year \\( y \\) is before 1582, the function calculates \\( p \\) using the Julian calendar formula.\n","\n","6. **Day and Month Calculation:**\n","   ```python\n","   m = p - 1\n","   day = 21 + m\n","   month = 3  # March\n","   if day > 31:  # 32 March = 1 April\n","       day -= 31\n","       month += 1\n","   ```\n","   - The variable \\( m \\) is derived from \\( p \\) and is used to calculate the day of the month.\n","   - The initial day is set to \\( 21 + m \\) to determine the specific date in March.\n","   - If the calculated day exceeds 31, it rolls over to April.\n","\n","7. **Return Statement:**\n","   ```python\n","   return day, month\n","   ```\n","   Finally, the function returns the calculated day and month of the Memorial.\n","\n","### Mathematical Summary\n","\n","The calculations primarily revolve around determining the **Paschal Full Moon** date, which can be summarized as:\n","\n","\\[\n","p = \n","\\begin{cases}\n","(3 -
